IUP Rust
========

_WARNING: this library is currently undergoing many changes!_

This library provides a high level wrapper around [IUP][1], a multi-platform
toolkit for building graphical user interfaces. See [rust-iup-sys](https://github.com/dcampbell24/rust-iup-sys) for low level bindings.

Features
--------

The library is currently undergoing significant changes in its architecture to
move toward a more Rustic approach using structs and traits to wrap IUP objects.

More to come soon.

Installation
------------

See [rust-iup-sys](https://github.com/dcampbell24/rust-iup-sys) for
information on installing the IUP system libraries needed to use this library.

Contribute
----------

Contributions are welcome both in the form of ideas for how to best wrap IUP in
Rust and high level wrappers for more of IUP. If you want to work on something,
please open a issue to let others know what you are working on.
